## Learn to code with MATLAB
Question 1 
Compute 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5 ... 1/40

### 1. Using Commands to compute

You can dirctly enter commands at command line
```Matlab
>> 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8+1/9+1/10+1/11+1/12+1/13+1/14+1/15+1/16+1/17+1/18+1/19+1/20+1/21+1/22+1/23+1/24+1/25+1/26+1/27+1/28+1/29+1/30+1/31+1/32+1/33+1/34+1/35+1/36+1/37+1/38+1/39+1/40
```

MATLAB adds variable ans to the workspace and displays the result in the Command Window.
> ans = 4.2785

Note: Some commands 
> `clc` : Clear command window <br>
> `clear`: Clear all data at Workspace <br>
> `...` : Continue a statement to the next line <br> 

```Matlab
>> 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8+1/9+1/10 ... 
+1/11+1/12+1/13+1/14+1/15+1/16+1/17+1/18+1/19+1/20 ...
+1/21+1/22+1/23+1/24+1/25+1/26+1/27+1/28+1/29+1/30 ...
+1/31+1/32+1/33+1/34+1/35+1/36+1/37+1/38+1/39+1/40 
```


### 2. Creating a Script to compute
You can click `add a new script` to creat a script. Then, you can paste the code on the Editor.
